# WoN Platform Expansion Plans

A resilient architecture is flexible enough to expand as limitations are reached and to adapt as new requirements surface. This page explores the ways in which the World of Nuclear architure could support orders of magnitude more traffic, as well as additional popular features.

For reference, our baseline is the [current system design](.).

## Scalability

We can think about "what if" scenarios involing scale. Let's tackle the three most likely areas:

- Traffic: handling **_sudden spikes_** and **_order-of-magnitude increases_** in baseline engagement
- AI automation: bringing more agents online to interact with users and support operations
- Simulations (future feature): generating, storing and presenting "real-time" volumes of system data

### Scaling for Increased Traffic (i.e., Human Demand)

Current stats (2025-7-23):

- 1,500 unique visitors per days
- 285 visitors per day
- 187 MB served

### Handling AI Activity

### Supporting Simulations

## Scaling the Team - Process Evolution
