# World of Nuclear

What if you could learn about nuclear energy in a safe environment, with the support of people who are honest and enthusistic? What if you could combine scientific study and experimentation with discourse and creativity?

Zanzibar's World of Nuclear Energy (World of Nuclear, or WoN) is a digital platform for learning about nuclear energy using a variety of creative techniques. The dream is to create a comprehesive, though ever expanding, landscape of nuclear energy concepts and innovations. Through bite-sized lessons, experimental simulations, and civilized conversation, people can expand their awareness of the power of nuclear energy to benefit humanity and the world.

Who is Zanzibar? He's an upbeat, unapologetic proponent of nuclear energy. When you see his avatar face, you know you're in a safe place to talk and learn about nuclear energy.

The World of Nuclear is unique. It combines social and educational technologies into a platform with a singular focus on the beneficial uses of nuclear energy.

## Features

**_What Say You?_**

For many, the pathway into the World of Nuclear is a discussion forum called _What Say You?_ Members of the forum open topics of discussion and post their original thoughts. Others are prompted to respond with their own ideas with the challenge "What say you?" Members can react and respond to posts in a variety of ways, expressing agreement, interest, or opposing points of view.

While similar to other threaded social-media discussion forums, you will never be banned or blocked for saying positive things about nuclear energy or politely expressing your opinions and beliefs.

Trolls are ignored into oblivion.

**_Micro Lessons_**

The World of Nuclear features micro lessons in the science and engineering that makes nuclear energy work for humanity. WoN lessons cover topics in a way that no academic textbook is allowed to. For instance, you might recognize a healthy dose of humor sprinkled throughout the lessons. While we want to convey the general ideas, the lessons are not meant as preparation for standardized tests or as formal vocational training. That means we can relax a little, and try to keep things interesting for a wide range of learners.

Topics advance quickly. For example, the course on atoms starts at the most basic and sweeps through fundamentals across a half-dozen domains. The intent is to expose all concepts, not just the easy ones, to inspire holistic, big-picture thinking. At the same time, each lesson is sized to be completed in about 10 minutes. Students choose from multiple paths through the lessons to match their interests and pace.

Over time, we hope to offer a variety of topics, from the basics of nuclear physics to the latest in nuclear medicine and the future of nuclear energy. The average high school student or graduate should be able to learn a lot from WoN lessons. College-level students and beyond will also find enlightenment and inspiration to explore unfamiliar areas.

Knowledge is power. The best way to overcome debilitating myths, misinformation, and outright lies about nuclear energy is to understand the fundamentals. World of Nuclear lessons move the world toward the light.

**_Games_**

A playful mind is a receptive mind. That's why games are an important aspect of learning. The World of Nuclear takes this idea to heart. Word searches, which are great for becoming familiar with technical terms, are just the start. Soon, WoN will offer games based on simulations and roll playing. Someday, WoN will give you the power to build and operate a (virtual) nuclear empire.

**_Simulators_**

To round out the learnings, the World of Nuclear intends to offer a simulator lab for experimenting with concepts, giving people a better sense of how things work. There's a lot of work ahead to make this possible. All we can say at this point is that you're going to love assembling and caring for your own nuclear power plant.
