# About Nuclear Ambitions

During World War II, governments and scientists doubled down to crack the code of nuclear energy. Standing on the shoulders of...well...each other, in addition to those who explored and discovered before them, humankind figured out how to extract massive amounts of energy from some of the smallest particles in existence.

Then stuff really started to happen. Bad stuff came first, then a whole lot of good stuff with some bad stuff mixed in to trip things up.

Then the world got cold feet about hot reactors, and we drifted for decades, reaping the advantages of nuclear energy without pushing to hard to expand our expertise.

...Here is where we tell more of the tale...

Do you like the radiation symbol I made? I followed [the spec from this article](https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/how-are-universal-ionizing-radiation-symbols-used-around-the-world).

## Mission

Nuclear Ambitions is here to encourage the world to keep advancing with nuclear energy. We want to get more from nuclear and reduce or mitigate the negative side effects. We want to expand our ability to tap into life-giving energy so that humanity can thrive. With abundance, people will have less interest in using nuclear energy for destructive ends, which will be a positive side effect.

Join us in helping people learn about nuclear energy in all the creative ways we can dream of.
